    -v, --version           shows the version

The subcommands are:
    host        Detect bacterial host from a metaHiC network binned by metaTOR
                given a annotated phages list.
    binning     Build phages MAGs based on metagenomic binning using metabat2
                and the host detection from the metaHiC data.
    pipeline    Use both others command and run them sequentially.
