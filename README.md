# MetaVir

Metagenomics phage bacterial host detection and phage binning pipeline based on HiC data and short reads assembly.

The goal of this pipeline is to detect phage bacterial host and to build phage MAGs based on the contig host detected, and a classical binning of the contigs based on the covergae and the sequences.
